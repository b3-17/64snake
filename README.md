# 64 SNAKE!

A snake game project, built for the commodore 64 in 6502 assembly.

* Inspiration taken from this website https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/. 
* Custom tailored for the commodore 64 memory map.
* Doesn't use zero page addresses to keep BASIC functional.
* Project layout based on dustlayer project layouts (with high level index.asm as assembly target).
* Assemble with acme assembler - using acme opcodes.
* Default controls with W,A,S,D - no joystick support.
* Builds to .prg file which works in VICE.
